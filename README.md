Stock Notebook Website Project

The website allows the user to generate a list of stocks that they searched for. Each stock in the list is a link that leads to a chart of current data on that stock. The user can also choose to the tabular data of the last stock they added to their list by clicking the "See Table" button or clicking the "Stock Table" tab at the top.
